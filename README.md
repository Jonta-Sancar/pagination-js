# - pagination.js
### A javascript function to handle your pagination

This project creates pagination for your pages, changing the ```page``` value of your URL.

  - If you need to go to the next page, you can use:
    ```js
      pagination('+');
    ```

  - If you need to go to the previous page, you can use:
    ```js
      pagination('-');
    ```

  - If you need to go to a specific page, you can use:
    ```js
      pagination(5);
    ```

It's that simple.
